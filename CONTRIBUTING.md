# Contributing to Network Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Network Library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our coding style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use modern C++ features (C++17 or later)
- Follow the existing code style
- Document all public APIs
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors appropriately

## Testing

- Add tests for new features
- Run the full test suite before submitting
- Test on different Windows versions
- Include performance tests if relevant

## Documentation

- Update README.md with details of changes
- Update API documentation
- Add notes to CHANGELOG.md
- Include examples for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with notes on your changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of maintainers

## Any Questions?

Feel free to contact the project maintainers if you have any questions!
